				<b>Synopsis:</b><br><p>Buried in debt due to his young daughter’s illness, his marriage at 
				the brink, Mario reluctantly takes a job as a hitman, surprising himself with his proclivity 
				for violence. After tragedy destroys the life he knew, Mario agrees to one final job: hijack a 
				cartel’s cash shipment before it reaches Mexico. Along with an old friend and a cartel-insider 
				named Juanca, Mario sets off on the near-suicidal mission, which will leave him with either a cool
				$200,000 or a bullet in the skull. But the path to reward or ruin is never as straight as 
				it seems. As the three complicated men travel through the endless landscape of Texas, 
				across the border and back, their hidden motivations are laid bare alongside nightmarish 
				encounters that defy explanation. One thing is certain: even if Mario makes it out alive, 
				he won’t return the same.
